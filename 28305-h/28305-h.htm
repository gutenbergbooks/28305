<i>MR. AND MRS. WILLIS CAMPBELL</i></h2>


<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Now this, I
think, is the most exciting part of
the whole affair, and the pleasantest."
She is seated at breakfast in her cottage
at Summering-by-the-Sea. A heap of
letters of various stylish shapes, colors,
and superscriptions lies beside her plate,
and irregularly straggles about among
the coffee-service. Vis-à-vis with her sits
Mr. Campbell behind a newspaper. "How
prompt they are! Why, I didn't expect
to get half so many answers yet. But
that shows that where people have nothing
to do <i>but</i> attend to their social duties
they are always prompt&mdash;even the men;
women, of course, reply early anyway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and you don't really care for them; but
in town the men seem to put it off till
the very last moment, and then some of
them call when it's over to excuse themselves
for not having come after accepting.
It really makes you wish for a leisure
class. It's only the drive and hurry
of American life that make our men
seem wanting in the <i>convenances</i>; and if
they had the time, with their instinctive
delicacy, they would be perfect: it
would come from the heart: they're more
truly polite now. Willis, just <i>look</i> at
this!"</p>

<p>Campbell, behind his paper: "Look at
what?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "These replies. Why,
I do believe that more than half the people
have answered already, and the invitations
only went out yesterday. That
comes from putting on R.S.V.P. I knew
I was right, and I shall always do it, I
don't care what <i>you</i> say."</p>

<p>Campbell: "You didn't put on R.S.V.P.
after all I said?" He looks round the
edge of his paper at her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "<i>Yes</i>, I did. The idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of your setting up for an authority in such
a thing as that!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Then I'm sorry I didn't
ask you to do it. It's a shame to make
people say whether they'll come to a
garden-party from four till seven or
not."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "A shame? How can
you provide if you don't know how many
are coming? I should like to know that.
But of course I couldn't expect you to
give in gracefully."</p>

<p>Campbell: "I should give in gracefully
if I gave in at all, but I don't." He throws
his paper down beside his chair. "Here,
hand over the letters, and I'll be opening
them for you while you pour out the
coffee."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, covering the letters
with her hands: "Indeed you won't!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Well, pour out the coffee,
then, anyway."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, after a moment's reflection:
"No, I shall not do it. I'm going
to open them every one before you get a
drop of coffee&mdash;just to punish you."</p>

<p>Campbell: "To punish me? For what?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Mrs. Campbell hesitates, as if at a loss
what to say. "There! you don't know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Yes, I do: for saying
I oughtn't to have put on R.S.V.P. Do
you take it back?"</p>

<p>Campbell: "How can I till I've had
some coffee? My mind won't work on
an empty stomach. Well&mdash;" He rises
and goes round the table towards her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, spreading both arms
over the letters: "Willis, if you dare to
touch them, I'll ring for Jane, and then
she'll see you cutting up."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Touch what? I'm coming
to get some coffee."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Well, I'll give you
some coffee; but don't you touch a single
one of those letters&mdash;after what
you've said."</p>

<p>Campbell: "All right!" He extends
one hand for the coffee, and with the
other sweeps all the letters together, and
starts back to his place. As she flies
upon him, "Look out, Amy; you'll make
me spill this coffee all over the table-cloth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, sinking into her seat:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
"Oh, Willis, how can you be so base?
<i>Give</i> me my letters. <i>Do!</i>"</p>

<p>Campbell, sorting them over: "You
may have half."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "No; I shall have all.
I insist upon it."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Well, then, you may have
all the ladies' letters. There are twice as
many of them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "No; I shall have the
men's, too. Give me the men's first."</p>

<p>Campbell: "How can I tell which are
the men's without opening them?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "How could you tell
which were the ladies'? Come, now,
Willis, don't tease me any longer. You
know I hate it."</p>

<p>Campbell, studying the superscriptions,
one after another: "I want to see if I can
guess who wrote them. Don't you like
to guess who wrote your letters before
you open them?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, with dignity: "I don't
like to guess who wrote other people's
letters." She looks down at the table-cloth
with a menace of tears, and Campbell
instantly returns all the notes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Campbell: "There, Amy; you may
have them. I don't care who wrote them,
nor what's in them. And I don't want
you to interrupt me with any exclamations
over them, if you please." He
reaches to the floor for his newspaper,
and while he sips his coffee, Mrs. Campbell
loses no time in opening her letters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "I shall do nothing
<i>but</i> exclaim. The Curwens accept, of
course&mdash;the very first letter. That means
Mrs. Curwen; that is one, at any rate.
The New York Addingses do, and the
Philadelphia Addingses don't; I hardly
expected they would, so soon after their
aunt's death, but I thought I ought to
ask them. Mr. and Mrs. Roberts, naturally;
it was more a joke than anything,
sending their invitation. Mrs. and the
Misses Carver regret very much; well, <i>I</i>
don't. Professor and Mrs. Traine are
very happy, and so am I; he doesn't go
everywhere, and he's awfully nice. Mr.
and Mrs. Lou Bemis are very happy, too,
and Dr. Lawton is very happy. Mrs.
Bridges Dear Mrs. Campbells me, and is
very sorry in the first person; she's always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
nice. Mr. Phillips, Mr. Rangeley,
Mr. Small, Mr. Peters, Mr. Staples, Mr.
Thornton, <i>all</i> accept, and they're all
charming young fellows."</p>

<p>Campbell, around his paper: "Well,
what of that?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, with an air of busy preoccupation:
"Don't eavesdrop, please;
I wasn't talking to you. The Merrills
have the pleasure, and the Morgans are
sorrow-stricken; the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Yes, but why should you
care whether those fellows are charming
or not? Who's going to marry them?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "<i>I</i> am. Mrs. Stevenson
is bowed to the earth; Colonel Murphree
is overjoyed; the Misses Ja&mdash;"</p>

<p>Campbell, putting his paper down:
"Look here, Amy. Do you know that
you have one little infinitesimal ewe-lamb
of a foible? You think too much of young
men."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "<i>Younger</i> men, you
mean. And <i>you</i> have a multitude of perfectly
mammoth peccadilloes. You interrupt."
She goes on opening and
reading her letters. "Well, I didn't expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the Macklines <i>could</i>; but everybody
seems to be coming."</p>

<p>Campbell: "You pay them too much
attention altogether. It spoils them; and
one of these days you'll be getting some
of them in love with you, and <i>then</i> what
will you do?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, with affected distraction:
"What <i>are</i> you talking about? I'd
refer them to you, and you could kill
them. I suppose you killed lots of people
in California. That's what you always
gave me to understand." She goes
on with her letters.</p>

<p>Campbell: "I never killed a single human
being that I can remember; but
there's no telling what I might do if I
were provoked. Now, there's that young
Welling. He's about here under my feet
all the time; and he's got a way lately of
coming in through the window from the
piazza that's very intimate. He's a nice
fellow enough, and sweet, as you say. I
suppose he has talent, too, but I never
heard that he had set any of the adjacent
watercourses on fire; and I don't know
that he could give the Apollo Belvedere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
many points in beauty and beat
him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "<i>I</i> do. Mrs. and Miss
Rice accept, and her friend Miss Greenway,
who's staying with her, and&mdash;yes!
here's one from Mr. Welling! <i>Oh</i>, how
glad I am! Willis, dearest, if I <i>could</i> be
the means of bringing those two lovely
young creatures together, I should be <i>so</i>
happy! <i>Don't</i> you think, now, he <i>is</i> the
most delicate-minded, truly refined, exquisitely
modest young fellow that ever
was?" She presses the unopened note
to her corsage, and leans eagerly forward
entreating a sympathetic acquiescence.</p>

<p>Campbell: "Well, as far as I can remember
my own youth, no. But what
does he say?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, regarding the letter: "I
haven't looked yet. He writes the <i>most</i>
characteristic hand, for a man, that I ever
saw. And he has the divinest taste in
perfumes! Oh, I wonder what <i>that</i> is?
Like a memory&mdash;a regret." She presses
it repeatedly to her pretty nose, in the
endeavor to ascertain.</p>

<p>Campbell: "Oh, hello!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, laughing: "Willis, you
<i>are</i> delightful. I should like to see you
really jealous once."</p>

<p>Campbell: "You won't, as long as I
know my own incomparable charm. But
give me that letter, Amy, if you're not
going to open it. I want to see whether
Welling is going to come."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, fondly: "Would you
<i>really</i> like to open it? I've half a mind
to let you, just for a reward."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Reward! What for?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Oh, I don't know.
Being so nice."</p>

<p>Campbell: "That's something I can't
help. It's no merit. Well, hand over
the letter."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "I should have thought
you'd insist on <i>my</i> opening it, after that."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Why?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "To show your confidence."</p>

<p>Campbell: "When I haven't got any?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, tearing the note open:
"Well, it's no use trying any sentiment
with you, or any generosity either. You're
always just the same; a teasing joke is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
your ideal. You can't imagine a woman's
wanting to keep up a little romance all
through; and a character like Mr. Welling's,
who's all chivalry and delicacy and
deference, is quite beyond you. That's
the reason you're always sneering at him."</p>

<p>Campbell: "I'm not sneering at him,
my dear. I'm only afraid Miss Rice isn't
good enough for him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, instantly placated:
"Well, she's the only girl who's anywhere
<i>near</i> it. I don't say she's faultless, but
she has a great deal of character, and
she's very practical; just the counterpart
of his dreaminess; and she <i>is</i> very, <i>very</i>
good-looking, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Her bang isn't so nice as
his."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "No; and aren't his
eyes beautiful? And that high, serious
look! And his nose and chin are perfectly
divine. He looks like a young
god!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "I dare say; though I never
saw an old one. Well, is he coming?
I'm not jealous, but I'm impatient. Read
it out loud."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, sinking back in her
chair for the more luxurious perusal of
the note: "Indeed I shall not." She
opens it and runs it hastily through, with
various little starts, stares, frowns, smiles
of arrested development, laughs, and
cries: "Why&mdash;why! What does it mean?
Is he crazy? Why, there's some mistake.
No! It's his hand&mdash;and here's his
name. I can't make it out." She reads
it again and again. "Why, it's perfectly
bewildering! Why, there must be some
mistake. He couldn't have meant it.
Could he have imagined? Could he have
dared? There never has been the slightest
thing that could be tortured into&mdash;But
of course not. And Mr. Welling,
of all men! Oh, I can't understand it!
Oh, Willis, Willis, Willis! What <i>does</i> it
mean?" She flings the note wildly across
the table, and catching her handkerchief
to her face, falls back into her chair, tumultuously
sobbing.</p>

<p>Campbell, with the calm of a man accustomed
to emotional superabundance,
lifting the note from the toast-rack before
him: "Well, let's see." He reads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
aloud: "'Oh, my darling! How can I
live till I see you? I will be there long
<i>before</i> the hour! To think of your <i>asking</i>
me! You should have said, "I permit
you to come," and I would have flown
from the ends of the earth. The presence
of others will be nothing. It will
be sweet to ignore them in my heart, and
while I see you moving among them, and
looking after their pleasure with that
beautiful thoughtfulness of yours, to
think, "She is mine, mine, mine!"</p>

<span class="i0">"Oh, young lord lover, what sighs are those<br /></span>

<p>I thank you, and thank you a thousand
times over, for this proof of your trust in
me, and of your love&mdash;<i>our</i> love. You
shall be the sole keeper of our secret&mdash;it
is so sweet to think that no one even suspects
it!&mdash;and it shall live with you, and
if you will, it shall die with me. Forever
yours, Arthur Welling.'" Campbell turns
the note over, and picking up the envelope,
examines the address. "Well, <i>upon</i>
my word! It's to you, Amy&mdash;on the outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
anyway. What do you suppose he
means?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, in her handkerchief:
"Oh, I don't know; I <i>don't</i> know why he
should address such language to me!"</p>

<p>Campbell, recurring to the letter: "<i>I</i>
never did. '<i>Oh, my darling&mdash;live till I
see you&mdash;ends of the earth&mdash;others will be
nothing&mdash;beautiful thoughtfulness&mdash;mine,
mine, mine&mdash;our love&mdash;sweet to think no
one suspects it&mdash;forever yours.</i>' Amy,
these are pretty strong expressions to use
towards the wife of another, and she a
married lady! I think I had better go
and solve that little problem of how he
can live till he sees you by relieving him
of the necessity. It would be disagreeable
to him, but perhaps there's a social
duty involved."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Oh, Willis, <i>don't</i> torment
me! What do you suppose it
means? Is it some&mdash;mistake? It's for
somebody else!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "I don't see why he should
have addressed it to you, then."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "But don't you see?
He's been writing to some other person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
at the same time, and he's got the answers
mixed&mdash;put them in the wrong envelopes.
Oh dear! I wonder who she
is!"</p>

<p>Campbell, studying her with an air of
affected abstraction: "Her curiosity gets
the better of her anguish. Look here,
Amy! <i>I</i> believe you're <i>afraid</i> it's to some
one else."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Willis!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Yes. And before we proceed
any further I must know just what
you wrote to this&mdash;this Mr. Welling of
yours. Did you put on R.S.V.P.?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Yes; and just a
printed card like all the rest. I did want
to write him a note in the first person,
and urge him to come, because I expected
Miss Rice and Miss Greenway to help me
receive; but when I found Margaret had
promised Mrs. Curwen for the next day,
I knew she wouldn't like to take the
bloom off that by helping me first; so I
didn't."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Didn't what?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Write to him. I just
sent a card."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Campbell: "Then these passionate expressions
<i>are</i> unprovoked, and my duty
is clear. I must lose no time in destroying
Mr. Welling. Do you happen to
know where I laid my revolver?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Oh, Willis, what are
you going to do? You see it's a mistake."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Mr. Welling has got to
prove that. I'm not going to have young
men addressing my wife as Oh their darling,
without knowing the reason why.
It's a liberty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, inclined to laugh: "Ah,
Willis, how funny you are!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Funny? I'm furious."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "You know you're not.
Give me the letter, dearest. I know it's
for Margaret Rice, and I shall see her,
and just feel round and find out if it isn't
so, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Campbell: "What an idea! You haven't
the slightest evidence that it's for Miss
Rice, or that it isn't intended for you,
and it's my duty to find out. And nobody
is authority but Mr. Welling. And
I'm going to him with the <i>corpus delicti</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "But how can you?
Remember how sensitive, how shrinking
he is. Don't, Willis; you mustn't. It will
kill him!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Well, that may save me
considerable bother. If he will simply
die of himself, I can't ask anything better."
He goes on eating his breakfast.</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, admiring him across
the table: "Oh, Willis, how perfectly delightful
you are!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "I know; but why?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Why, taking it in the
nice, sensible way you do. Now, some
husbands would be so stupid! Of course
you <i>couldn't</i> think&mdash;you couldn't <i>dream</i>&mdash;that
the letter was really for me; and yet
you might behave very disagreeably, and
make me very unhappy, if you were not
just the lovely, kind-hearted, magnanimous&mdash;"</p>

<p>Campbell, looking up from his coffee:
"Oh, hello!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Yes; that is what took
my fancy in you, Willis: that generosity,
that real gentleness, in spite of the brusque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
way you have. Refinement of the heart,
<i>I</i> call it."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Amy, what are you after?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "We've been married
a whole year now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Longer, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "&mdash;And I haven't
known you do an unkind thing, a brutal
thing."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Well, I understand the
banging around hardly ever begins much
under two years."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "How <i>sweet</i> you are!
And you're <i>so</i> funny always!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Come, come, Amy; get
down to business. What is it you do
want?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "You won't go and
tease that poor boy about his letter, will
you? Just hand it to him, and say you
suppose here is something that has come
into your possession by mistake, and that
you wish to restore it to him, and then&mdash;just
run off."</p>

<p>Campbell: "With my parasol in one
hand, and my skirts caught up in the
other?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Oh, how good! Of
course I was imagining how <i>I</i> should do
it."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Well, a man can't do it
that way. He would look silly." He
rises from the table, and comes and puts
his arm round her shoulders. "But you
needn't be afraid of my being rough
with him. Of course it's a mistake; but
he's a fellow who will enter into the joke
too; he'll enjoy it; he'll&mdash;" He merges
his sentence in a kiss on her upturned
lips, and she clings to his hand with her
right, pressing it fondly to her cheek.
"I shall do it in a man's way; but I guess
you'll approve of it quite as much."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "I know I shall. That's
what I like about you, Willis: your being
so helplessly a man always."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Well, that's what attracted
me to you, Amy; your manliness."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "And I liked your
<i>finesse</i>. You are awfully inventive, Willis.
Why, Willis, I've just thought of something.
Oh, it would be <i>so</i> good if you
only would!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Would what?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Invent something
now to get us out of the scrape."</p>

<p>Campbell: "What a brilliant idea! <i>I'm</i>
not in any scrape. And as for Mr. Welling,
I don't see how you could help him
out unless you sent this letter to Miss
Rice, and asked her to send yours back&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, springing to her feet:
"Willis, you are inspired! Oh, how perfectly
delightful! And it's so delicate of
you to think of that! I will just enclose
his note&mdash;give it here, Willis&mdash;and he
need never know that it ever went to the
wrong address. Oh, I always felt that
you were <i>truly</i> refined, anyway." He
passively yields the letter, and she whirls
away to a writing-desk in the corner of
the room. "Now, I'll just keep a copy
of the letter&mdash;for a joke; I think I've a
perfect right to"&mdash;scribbling furiously
away&mdash;"and then I'll match the paper
with an envelope&mdash;I can do that perfectly&mdash;and
then I'll just imitate his hand&mdash;such
fun!&mdash;and send it flying over to Margaret
Rice. Oh, <i>how</i> good! Touch the
bell, Willis;" and then&mdash;as the serving-maid
appears&mdash;"Yes, Jane! Run right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
across the lawn to Mrs. Rice's, and give
this letter for Miss Margaret, and say it
was left here by mistake. Well, it <i>was</i>,
Willis. Fly, Jane! Oh, Willis, love!
Isn't it perfect! Of course she'll have
got his formal reply to my invitation, and
be all mixed up by it, and now when this
note comes, she'll see through it all in an
instant, and it will be such a relief to her;
and oh, she'll think that he's directed <i>both</i>
the letters to her because he couldn't
think of any one else! Isn't it lovely?
Just like anything that's nice, it's ten
times as nice as you expected it to be;
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Campbell: "But hold on, Amy!" He
lifts a note from the desk. "You've sent
your copy. Here's the original now.
She'll think you've been playing some
joke on her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, clutching the letter from
him, and scanning it in a daze: "<i>What!</i>
Oh, my goodness! It is! I have! Oh,
I shall die! Run! Call her back! Shriek,
Willis!" They rush to the window together.
"No, no! It's too late! She's
given it to their man, and now nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
can save me! Oh, Willis! Willis! Willis!
This is all your fault, with that fatal
suggestion of yours. Oh, if you had only
left it to me I never should have got into
such a scrape! She will think now that
I've been trying to hoax her, and she's
perfectly implacable at the least hint of a
liberty, and she'll be ready to kill me. I
don't know <i>what</i> she won't do. Oh, Willis,
how <i>could</i> you get me into this!"</p>

<p>Campbell, irately: "Get you into this!
Now, Amy, this is a little too much. You
got yourself into it. You urged me to
think of something&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Well, do, Willis, <i>do</i>
think of something, or I shall go mad!
Help me, Willis! Don't be so heartless&mdash;so
unfeeling."</p>

<p>Campbell: "There's only one thing
now, and that is to make a clean breast
of it to Welling, and get him to help us
out. A word from him can make everything
right, and we can't take a step without
him; we can't move!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "I can't let you. Oh,
isn't it horrible!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Yes; a nice thing is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
ten times nicer than you expected it
to be!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Oh, how can you
stand there mocking me? Why don't you
go to him at once, and tell him the whole
thing, and beg him, implore him, to help
us?"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Why, you just told me I
mustn't!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "You didn't expect me
to say you might, did you? Oh, how
cruel!" She whirls out of the room, and
Campbell stands in a daze, in which he is
finally aware of Mr. Arthur Welling, seen
through the open window, on the veranda
without. Mr. Welling, with a terrified
and furtive air, seems to be fixed to
the spot where he stands.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<br /><br />

<i>MR. WELLING; MR. CAMPBELL</i></h2>


<p>Campbell: "Why, Welling, what the
devil are you doing there?"</p>

<p>Welling: "Trying to get away."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Campbell: "To get away? But you
sha'n't, man! I won't let you. I was
just going to see you. How long have
you been there?"</p>

<p>Welling: "I've just come."</p>

<p>Campbell: "What have you heard?"</p>

<p>Welling: "Nothing&mdash;nothing. I was
knocking on the window-casing to make
<i>you</i> hear, but you seemed preoccupied."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Preoccupied! convulsed!
cataclysmed! Look here: we're in a box,
Welling. And you've got us into it."
He pulls Welling's note out of his pocket,
where he has been keeping his hand on
it, and pokes it at him. "Is that yours?"</p>

<p>Welling, examining it with bewilderment
mounting into anger: "It's mine;
yes. May I ask, Mr. Campbell, how you
came to have this letter?"</p>

<p>Campbell: "May I ask, Mr. Welling,
how you came to write such a letter to
my wife?"</p>

<p>Welling: "To your wife? To Mrs.
Campbell? I never wrote any such letter
to her."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Then you addressed it to
her."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Welling: "Impossible!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Impossible? I think I can
convince you, much as I regret to do so."
He makes search about Mrs. Campbell's
letters on the table first, and then on the
writing-desk. "We have the envelope.
It came amongst a lot of letters, and
there's no mistake about it." He continues
to toss the letters about, and then
desists. "But no matter; I can't find it;
Amy's probably carried it off with her.
There's no mistake about it. I was going
to have some fun with you about it, but
now you can have some fun with me.
Whom did you send Mrs. Campbell's letter
to?"</p>

<p>Welling: "Mrs. Campbell's letter?"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Oh, pshaw! your acceptance
or refusal, or whatever it was, of her
garden fandango. You got an invitation?"</p>

<p>Welling: "Of course."</p>

<p>Campbell: "And you wrote to accept
it or decline it at the same time that you
wrote this letter here to some one else.
And you addressed two envelopes before
you put the notes in either. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
you put them into the wrong envelopes.
And you sent this note to my wife, and
the other note to the other person&mdash;"</p>

<p>Welling: "No, I didn't do anything of
the kind!" He regards Campbell with
amazement, and some apparent doubt of
his sanity.</p>

<p>Campbell: "Well, then, Mr. Welling,
will you allow me to ask what the deuce
you did do?"</p>

<p>Welling: "I never wrote to Mrs. Campbell
at all. I thought I would just drop
in and tell her why I couldn't come. It
seemed so formal to write."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Then will you be kind
enough to tell me whom you <i>did</i> write to?"</p>

<p>Welling: "No, Mr. Campbell, I can't
do that."</p>

<p>Campbell: "You write such a letter as
that to my wife, and then won't tell me
whom it's to?"</p>

<p>Welling: "No! And you've no right
to ask me."</p>

<p>Campbell: "I've no right to ask you?"</p>

<p>Welling: "No. When I tell you that
the note wasn't meant for Mrs. Campbell,
that's enough."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Campbell: "I'll be judge of that, Mr.
Welling. You say that you were not
writing two notes at the time, and that
you didn't get the envelopes mixed.
Then, if the note wasn't meant for my
wife, why did you address it to her?"</p>

<p>Welling: "That's what I can't tell;
that's what I don't know. It's as great
a mystery to me as it is to you. I can
only conjecture that when I was writing
that address I was thinking of coming to
explain to Mrs. Campbell that I was going
away to-day, and shouldn't be back
till after her party. It was too complicated
to put in a note without seeming
to give my regrets too much importance.
And I suppose that when I was addressing
the note that I did write I put Mrs.
Campbell's name on because I had her so
much in mind."</p>

<p>Campbell, with irony: "Oh!"</p>

<i>MRS. CAMPBELL; MR. WELLING; MR. CAMPBELL</i></h2>


<p>Mrs. Campbell, appearing through the
portière that separates the breakfast-room
from the parlor beyond: "Yes!"
She goes up and gives her hand to Mr.
Welling with friendly frankness. "And
it was very nice of you to think of me at
such a time, when you ought to have
been thinking of some one else."</p>

<p>Welling, with great relief and effusion:
"Oh, thank you, Mrs. Campbell! I was
sure you would understand. You couldn't
have imagined me capable of addressing
such language to you; of presuming&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Of course not! And
Willis has quite lost his head. I saw in
an instant just how it was. I'm so sorry
you can't come to my party&mdash;"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Amy, have you been eavesdropping?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "There was no need
of eavesdropping. I could have heard
you out at Loon Rock Light, you shouted
so. But as soon as I recognized Mr.
Welling's voice I came to the top of the
stairs and listened. I was sure you would
do something foolish. But now I think
we had better make a clean breast of it,
and tell Mr. Welling just what we've done.
We knew, of course, the letter wasn't for
me, and we thought we wouldn't vex you
about it, but just send it to the one it <i>was</i>
meant for. We've surprised your secret,
Mr. Welling, though we didn't intend to;
but if you'll accept our congratulations&mdash;under
the rose, of course&mdash;we won't let it
go any further. It does seem so perfectly
ideal, and I feel like saying, Bless you,
my children! You've been in and out
here so much this summer, and I feel
just like an elder sister to Margaret."</p>

<p>Welling: "Margaret?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Well, Miss Rice,
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Welling: "Miss Rice?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, with dignity: "Oh, I'm
sorry if we seem to presume upon our <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>acquaintance
with the matter. We couldn't
very well help knowing it under the circumstances."</p>

<p>Welling: "Certainly, certainly&mdash;of
course: I don't mind that at all: I was
going to tell you, anyway: that was partly
the reason why I came instead of writing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Campbell, in an audible soliloquy: "I
supposed he <i>had</i> written."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, intensely: "Don't interrupt,
Willis! Well?"</p>

<p>Welling: "But I don't see what Miss
Rice has to do with it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "You don't see! Why,
isn't Margaret Rice the one&mdash;"</p>

<p>Welling: "What one?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "The one that you're
engaged&mdash;the one that the note was really
<i>for</i>?"</p>

<p>Welling: "No! What an idea! Miss
Rice? Not for an instant! It's&mdash;it's her
friend&mdash;Miss Greenway&mdash;who's staying
with her&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, in a very awful voice:
"Willis! Get me some water&mdash;some
wine! Help me! Ah! Don't touch me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
It was you, <i>you</i> who did it all! Oh, <i>now</i>
what shall I do?" She drops her head
upon Campbell's shoulder, while Welling
watches them in stupefaction.</p>

<p>Campbell: "It's about a million times
nicer than we could have expected.
That's the way with a nice thing when
you get it started. Well, young man,
you're done for; and so are we, for that
matter. We supposed that note which
you addressed to Mrs. Campbell was intended
for Miss Rice&mdash;"</p>

<p>Welling: "Ho, ho, ho! Ah, ha, ha!
Miss Rice? Ha&mdash;"</p>

<p>Campbell: "I'm glad you like it.
You'll enjoy the rest of it still better. We
thought it was for Miss Rice, and my
wife neatly imitated your hand on an envelope
and sent it over to her just before
you came in. Funny, isn't it? Laugh
on! Don't mind <i>us</i>!"</p>

<p>Welling, aghast: "Thought my note
was for Miss Rice? Sent it to her?
Gracious powers!" They all stand for
a moment in silence, and then Welling
glances at the paper in his hand. "But
there's some mistake. You haven't sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
my note to Miss Rice: here it is
now!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Oh, that's the best of the
joke. Mrs. Campbell took a copy"&mdash;Mrs.
Campbell moans&mdash;"she meant to have
some fun with you about it, and it's ten
times as much fun as <i>I</i> expected; and in
her hurry she sent off her copy and kept
the original. Perhaps that makes it better."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, detaching herself from
him and confronting Mr. Welling: "No;
worse! She'll think we've been trying to
hoax her, and she'll be in a towering
rage; and she'll show the note to Miss
Greenway, and you'll be ruined. Oh
poor Mr. Welling! Oh, what a fatal,
fatal&mdash;mix!" She abandons herself in an
attitude of extreme desperation upon a
chair, while the men stare at her, till
Campbell breaks the spell by starting forward
and ringing the bell on the table.</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "What are you doing,

<p>Campbell: "Ringing for Jane." As
Jane appears: "Did you give Miss Rice

watching for her ever since. I can always
see them come, from the pantry
window."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Well, then, don't
stand there talking, but run at once! Oh,
Willis! Never tell me again that there's
no such thing as an overruling providence.
Oh, what an interposition! Oh,
I can never be grateful and humble
enough&mdash;Goodness me, Jane! why don't
you go?"</p>

<p>Jane: "Go where, ma'am? I don't know
what you want me to do. I'm willing
enough to do anything if I know what it
is, but it's pretty hard to do things if you
don't."</p>

<p>Campbell: "You're perfectly right,
Jane. Mrs. Campbell wants you to telegraph
yourself over to Mrs. Rice's, and
say to her that the letter you left for
Miss Rice is not for her, but another
lady, and Mrs. Campbell sent it by mistake.
Get it and bring it back here,
dead or alive, even if Mrs. Rice has to
pass over your mangled body in the attempt."</p>

<p>Jane, tasting the joke, while Mrs. Campbell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
gasps in ineffective efforts to reinforce
her husband's instructions: "I will
that, sir."</p>

<p>Campbell: "And now, while we're waiting,
let's all join hands and dance round
the table. You're saved, Welling. So
are you, Amy. And so am I&mdash;which is
more to the point."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, gayly: "Dansons!" She
extends her hands to the gentlemen, and
as they circle round the breakfast-table
she sings,</p>

<p>Then she catches hands with them again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and they circle round the table as before,
singing,</p>

<p>Oh, dear! Stop! I'm dizzy&mdash;I shall
fall." She spins into a chair, while the
men continue solemnly circling by themselves.</p>

<p>Campbell: "It is a sacred dance:</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, springing from her chair

right in here, Jane! Did you get it? Give
it to me, Jane!"</p>

<p>Welling: "<i>I</i> think it belongs to me, Mrs.

<p>Welling: "Did you get it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Had she got back?"</p>

<p>Jane: "No, ma'am."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Did Mrs. Rice object to

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Yes, certainly."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Of course."</p>

<p>Welling: "Here." They all pour glasses
of water and press them to her lips.</p>

<p>Jane, pushing the glasses away, and escaping
from the room: "They thought
Mrs. Campbell was in a great hurry for
Miss Rice to have the letter, and they
sent off the man with it to meet her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Oh, merciful goodness!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "Another overruling providence.
Now you <i>are</i> in for it, my boy!
So is Amy. And so am I&mdash;which is still
more to the point."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Well, now, what shall
we do?"</p>

<p>Campbell: "All that we can do now is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to await developments: they'll come fast
enough. Miss Rice will open her letter
as soon as she gets it, and she won't understand
it in the least; how <i>could</i> she
understand a letter in your handwriting,
with Welling's name signed to it? She'll
show it to Miss Greenway&mdash;"</p>

<p>Welling: "Oh, don't say that!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "&mdash;Greenway; and Miss
Greenway won't know what to make of it
either. But she's the kind of girl who'll
form some lively conjectures when she
reads that letter. In the first place, she'll
wonder how Mr. Welling happens to be
writing to Miss Rice in that affectionate
strain&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, in an appealing shriek:
"Willis!"</p>

<p>Campbell: "&mdash;And she naturally won't
believe he's done it. But then, when
Miss Rice tells her it's your handwriting,
Amy, she'll think that you and Miss Rice
have been having your jokes about Mr.
Welling; and she'll wonder what kind of
person you are, anyway, to make free with
a young man's name that way."</p>

<p>Welling: "Oh, I assure you that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
admires Mrs. Campbell more than anybody."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Don't try to stop
him; he's fiendish when he begins teasing."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Oh, well! If she admires
Mrs. Campbell and confides in you, then
the whole affair is very simple. All you've
got to do is to tell her that after you'd
written her the original of that note, your
mind was so full of Mrs. Campbell and
her garden-party that you naturally addressed
it to her. And then Mrs. Campbell
can cut in and say that when she
got the note she knew it wasn't for her,
but she never dreamed of your caring for
Miss Greenway, and was so sure it was
for Miss Rice that she sent her a copy of
it. That will make it all right and perfectly
agreeable to every one concerned."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "And I can say that I
sent it at your suggestion, and then, instead
of trying to help me out of the awful,
awful&mdash;box, you took a cruel pleasure
in teasing me about it! But I shall not
say anything, for I shall not see them. I
will leave you to receive them and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the best of it. Don't <i>try</i> to stop me,
Willis." She threatens him with her fan
as he steps forward to intercept her escape.</p>

<p>Campbell: "No, no! Listen, Amy!
You <i>must</i> stay and see those ladies. It's
all well enough to leave it to me, but what
about poor Welling? <i>He</i> hasn't done anything&mdash;except
cause the whole trouble."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "I am very sorry, but I
can't help it. I must go." Campbell
continues to prevent her flight, and she
suddenly whirls about and makes a dash
at the open window. "Oh, very well,
then! I can get out this way." At the
same moment Miss Rice and Miss Greenway
appear before the window on the
piazza. "Ugh! E&mdash;e&mdash;e! How you
frightened me! But&mdash;but come in. So
gl&mdash;glad to see you! And you&mdash;you too,
Miss Greenway. Here's Mr. Welling.
He's been desolating us with a story
about having to be away over my party,
and just getting back for Mrs. Curwen's.
Isn't it too bad? Can't some of you
young ladies&mdash;or all of you&mdash;make him
stay?" As Mrs. Campbell talks on, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
readjusts her spirit more and more to the
exigency, and subdues her agitation to a
surface of the sweetest politeness.</p>

<i>MISS RICE, MISS GREENWAY, and the
OTHERS</i></h2>


<p>Miss Rice, entering with an unopened
letter in her hand, which she extends to
Mrs. Campbell: "What in the world does
it all mean, Mrs. Campbell, your sending
your letters flying after <i>me</i> at this rate?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, with a gasp: "My letters?"
She mechanically receives the
extended note, and glances at the superscription:
"<i>Mrs. Willis Campbell</i>. Ah!"
She hands it quickly to her husband, who
reads the address with a similar cry.</p>

<p>Campbell: "Well, well, Amy! This is
a pretty good joke on you. You've sealed
up one of your own notes, and sent it to
Miss Rice. Capital! Ah, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, with hysterical rapture:
"Oh, how delicious! What a ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
blunder! I don't wonder you were puzzled,
Margaret."</p>

<p>Welling: "What! Sent her your own
letter, addressed to yourself?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Yes. Isn't it amusing?"</p>

<p>Welling: "The best thing I ever heard
of."</p>

<p>Miss Rice: "Yes. And if you only
knew what agonies of curiosity Miss
Greenway and I had suffered, wanting to
open it and read it anyway, in spite of all
the decencies, I think you would read it
to us."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Or at least give Miss Rice
her own letter. What in the world did
you do with that?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "Put it in my desk,
where I thought I put mine. But never
mind it now. I can tell you what was in
it just as well. Come in here a moment,
Margaret." She leads the way to the
parlor, whither Miss Rice follows.</p>

<p>Miss Greenway, poutingly: "Oh, mayn't
I know, too? I think that's hardly fair,
Mrs. Campbell."</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell: "No; or&mdash;Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
may tell you afterwards; or Mr. Welling
may, <i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "How very formidable!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Campbell, over her shoulder, on
going out: "Willis, bring me the refusals
and acceptances, won't you? They're
up-stairs."</p>

<p>Campbell: "Delighted to be of any service."
Behind Miss Greenway's back he
dramatizes over her head to Welling
his sense of his own escape, and his compassion
for the fellow-man whom he
leaves in the toils of fate.</p>

<p>Welling: "Nelly!" He approaches, and
timidly takes her hand.</p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "Arthur! That letter
was addressed in your handwriting.
Will you please explain?"</p>

<p>Welling: "Why, it's very simple&mdash;that
is, it's the most difficult thing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
world. Nelly, can you believe <i>any</i>thing
I say to you?"</p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "What nonsense! Of
course I can&mdash;if you're not too long about
it."</p>

<p>Welling: "Well, then, the letter in that
envelope was one I wrote to Mrs. Campbell&mdash;or
the copy of one."</p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "The copy?"</p>

<p>Welling: "But let me explain. You
see, when I got your note asking me to
be sure and come to Mrs. Curwen's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "Yes?"</p>

<p>Welling: "&mdash;I had just received an invitation
from Mrs. Campbell for her garden-party,
and I sat down and wrote to
you, and concluded I'd step over and tell
her why I couldn't come, and with that in
mind I addressed your letter&mdash;the one I'd
written you&mdash;to her."</p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "With my name inside?"</p>

<p>Welling: "No; I merely called you
'darling'; and when Mrs. Campbell
opened it she saw it couldn't be for her,
and she took it into her head it must be
for Miss Rice."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "For Margaret? What
an idea! But why did she put your envelope
on it?"</p>

<p>Welling: "She made a copy, for the
joke of it; and then, in her hurry, she enclosed
that in my envelope, and kept the
original and the envelope she'd addressed
to Miss Rice, and&mdash;and that's all."</p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "What a perfectly delightful
muddle! And how shall we get
out of it with Margaret?"</p>

<p>Welling: "With Margaret? I don't
care for her. It's you that I want to get
out of it with. And you do believe me&mdash;you
do forgive me, Nelly?"</p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "For what?"</p>

<p>Welling: "For&mdash;for&mdash;I don't know
what for. But I thought you'd be so
vexed."</p>

<p>Miss Greenway: "I shouldn't have
liked you to send a letter addressed darling
to Mrs. Curwen; but Mrs. Campbell
is different."</p>

<p>Welling: "Oh, how archangelically sensible!
How divine of you to take it in
just the right way!"</p>

<li>STUDIES OF THE STAGE. With Portrait. 16mo,
Cloth, Ornamental, $1.00.</li>

<li>Mr. Matthews writes of the stage intelligently and appreciatively&mdash;more
so, perhaps, than most Americans,
for the reason that he writes from the point of view of
the stage rather than that of the front of the house.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Times.</i></li>

<li>THE STORY OF A STORY, and Other Stories. Illustrated.
16mo, Cloth, Ornamental, $1.25.</li>

<li>These stories have a light felicitous touch that is well-nigh
the perfection of polished story-telling. They are
stamped with an exquisite refinement of the art, and every
telling point is delicately emphasized.&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></li>

<li>AMERICANISMS AND BRITICISMS, with Other
Essays on Other Isms. With Portrait. 16mo, Cloth,
Ornamental, $1.00.</li>

<li>A racy, delightful little book.... It is a long time
since we have met with such a combination of keen yet
fair criticism, genuine wit, and literary grace. The skill
with which certain limitations of English literary people,
past or present, are indicated is as impressive as it is
artistic.&mdash;<i>Congregationalist</i>, Boston.</li>

<li>One of the most remarkable qualities of Miss Woolson's
work was its intense picturesqueness. Few writers
have shown equal beauty in expressing the poetry of
landscape.&mdash;<i>Springfield Republican.</i>
</li>

<li>Characterization is Miss Woolson's forte. Her men
and women are original, breathing, and finely contrasted
creations.&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune.</i>
</li>

<li>Delightful touches justify those who see many points
of analogy between Miss Woolson and George Eliot.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Times.</i>
</li>

<li>Miss Woolson's power of describing natural scenery
and strange, out-of-the-way phases of American life is
undoubted. One cannot well help being fascinated by
her stories.&mdash;<i>Churchman</i>, N. Y.
</li>

<li>Miss Woolson is one of the few novelists of the day
who know how to make conversation, how to individualize
the speakers, how to exclude rabid realism without
falling into literary formality.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Tribune.</i></li>

<li>Always there is a freedom from commonplace, and a
power to hold the interest to the close, which is owing,
not to a trivial ingenuity, but to the spell which her personages
cast over the reader's mind as soon as they come
within his ken.&mdash;<i>Atlantic Monthly.</i></li>

<li>A gallery of striking studies in the humblest quarters
of American country life. No one has dealt with this
kind of life better than Miss Wilkins. Nowhere are
there to be found such faithful, delicately drawn, sympathetic,
tenderly humorous pieces.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Tribune.</i></li>
